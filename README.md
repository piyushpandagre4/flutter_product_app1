Flutter Product Management AppProject OverviewThis is a comprehensive mobile application built with Flutter, designed to help users efficiently manage a list of products. The application features a robust authentication system, allowing users to securely log in and access a personalized product dashboard. Once logged in, users can create new products, view their existing inventory, search for specific items, and delete products they no longer need. All product data is persisted locally using shared_preferences, ensuring that user-added items are available across app sessions.Key FeaturesUser Authentication:Secure login functionality using email and password.Integration with a mock API (https://reqres.in/api/login) for authentication.Seamless navigation to the Home Page upon successful login.Route protection: Users cannot access the Home Page without being logged in, and logged-in users are redirected from the Login Page.User-friendly Login UI inspired by the provided design, focusing on core email/password input (excluding external login options like Google).Product Management Dashboard:Product Listing: Displays a clear and organized list of all added products.Search Functionality: A dynamic search bar allows users to filter products by name in real-time, making it easy to find specific items.Product Deletion: Each product item includes a "delete" icon, enabling users to remove products with a confirmation step.Empty State Handling: Displays a "No Product Found" message when the product list is empty, guiding the user to add new items.Logout Option: A prominent logout button provides a secure way for users to end their session.Add Product Form:A dedicated form for adding new products, accessible via a Floating Action Button from the Home Page.Input fields for Product Name, Price, and an optional Image URL.Data Persistence: All added products are saved locally using Flutter's shared_preferences for reliable storage.Form Validation: Built-in validation ensures that both product name and price fields are required and correctly formatted.Duplicate Prevention: The application prevents the addition of products with duplicate names, maintaining data integrity.Robust Error Handling & User Feedback:Loading Indicators: Visual feedback (loading dialogs) is provided during API calls and data loading operations.Error Messages: Clear and concise error messages are displayed using toast/snackbar notifications for network issues, login failures, or validation errors.Technical StackFramework: Flutter (version >=3.0.0)Language: DartAPI Communication: http package for making REST API calls.Local Storage: shared_preferences package for persisting application data (login status, product list).UI/UX: Material Design principles with custom styling for a clean and intuitive user experience.Unique IDs: uuid package for generating unique identifiers for products.Notifications: fluttertoast package for displaying transient messages.Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesFlutter SDK installed (version 3.0.0 or higher recommended).A code editor like VS Code or Android Studio with Flutter and Dart plugins.InstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
