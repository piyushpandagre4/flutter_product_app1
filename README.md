This is a comprehensive mobile application built with Flutter, designed to help users efficiently manage a list of products. The application features a robust authentication system, allowing users to securely log in and access a personalized product dashboard. Once logged in, users can create new products, view their existing inventory, search for specific items, and delete products they no longer need. All product data is persisted locally using shared_preferences, ensuring that user-added items are available across app sessions.
